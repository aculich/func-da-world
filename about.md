My name is Oskar Wickstr√∂m and *Func Da World* is where I write about
functional programming, open source software, and other things I find
interesting.

You can find me at [Twitter][twitter] and [GitHub][github]. I'm involved in a
number of musical projects, and I post some of my stuff at
[SoundCloud][soundcloud] and [YouTube][youtube].
