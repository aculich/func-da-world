<p>
My strengths are functional programming and web development, and I am
specifically interested in working with Haskell, PureScript, and related
statically typed functional programming languages. You can <a
href="https://wickstrom.tech/cv.pdf">download my CV here</a>.
</p>

<p>As of July, 2017, I'll be employed by Mpowered Business Solutions,
writing Haskell remotely. I'm very excited for this!</p>

<h2>Portfolio</h2>

<p>Here follows some screenshots from sites and products I have been involved
in doing UI work on. While functional programming and web development are my
main strengths, CSS and design is something I have been doing throughout my
career, and still enjoy doing.</p>
