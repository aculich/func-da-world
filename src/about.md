My name is Oskar Wickstr√∂m and this website is called *Func Da World*. Here I
write about functional programming, open source software, and other delightful
things I like to share.

You can find me at [Twitter][twitter] and [GitHub][github]. I'm involved in a
number of musical projects, and I post some of my stuff at
[SoundCloud][soundcloud] and [YouTube][youtube].
